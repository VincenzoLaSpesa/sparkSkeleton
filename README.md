# sparkSkeleton
A minimal Spark web application. I use it as a base template for small projects.

**It's still WIP**

As soon as I finish this application should show how to:

-	Setup a spark application with routes
-	Obtain data from a custom folder
-	Obtain data from a SQLITE database
-	Generate static html output
-	Generate html output based on a template
