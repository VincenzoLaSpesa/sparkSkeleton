# sparkSkeleton
This project aims to be a minimal application server to host some of my test application on a raspberry pi.
So it's an application server with skeleton dependencies.

Using jetty and spark it's possible to build a complete web application with a footprint of 3.5MB only.

The repository include a sample show how to:

-	Setup a spark application with routes
-	Obtain data from a custom folder
-	Obtain data from an embedded Derby database with a minimal ORM (OrmLite)
-	Generate static html output
-	Generate html output based on a template
